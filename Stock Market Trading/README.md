# Stock Market Trading System - Java

The Stock Market Trading System that I created for the OOP module in which this project obtained full marks. 

# How to test the program
1. Download this folder, you should now have a ZIP file.
2. This project was intended to be used with the BlueJ IDE (in that case you can just simply go to project -> Open ZIP/JAR -> Select the ZIP folder you downloaded). For any other IDEs, just import all the files with the .java extension.
3. In order to start the program, go to the LoginGUI class, right click the "void main(String[] args)" button and then click ok at the next prompt.
4. To login to the system use the following details, username: admin, password: admin

# Some Pointers
- The program currently uses my own API key, you will have to obtain your own your own API key and I would suggest you purchase for more API calls if you desire for a more "realistic" simulation of the System. You can obtain your own API key by using the following link: https://twelvedata.com/
- Currently the API calls are made every 30s, you can easily bypass this by entering your own API key and purchasing your more API calls.
- If you so desire, you can add your own "users" to the system, just format the details similarly to how it is done in the accounts.txt file (be careful with the formatting for a real user and demo user account).
